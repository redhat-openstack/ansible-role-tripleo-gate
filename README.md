ansible-role-tripleo-gate
=========================

An Ansible role for generating custom RPMSs from upstream Gerrit changes in the
TripleO project using DLRN. This repo then can be injected in the tested
environment, a repo file created and a yum update should start using the built
RPMs.

Requirements
------------

* [DLRN](https://github.com/openstack-packages/DLRN)

Role Variables
--------------

* `artg_dlrn_repo_url` -- the URL of the DLRN repository
* `artg_rdoinfo_repo_url` -- the URL of the rdoinfo repository that contains
  the project definitions for DLRN
* `artg_compressed_gating_repo` -- a full path to a compressed repository that
  contains all the generated rpms
* `artg_change_list` -- a list of changes to gate. Only needed when not running
  in Zuul or Gerrit (see below). The format is:

```yaml
artg_change_list:
    - host: "review.openstack.org"
      project: "openstack/tripleo-heat-templates"
      branch: "master"
      refspec: "refs/changes/1/123456/1"
    - host: ...
```

Gating with Zuul or Jenkins
---------------------------

The role can also work with Zuul and Jenkins based gating jobs.

In case of Zuul, the role uses `ZUUL_HOST` and `ZUUL_CHANGES` vars to parse the
full set of dependent changes that were previously
[resolved by Zuul](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/zuul/gating.html#cross-repository-dependencies).

If we're running in a Jenkins environment with the
[Gerrit Trigger plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger),
`GERRIT_HOST`, `GERRIT_CHANGE_ID` and `GERRIT_PATCHSET_REVISION` are used to
detect the gated change. The role then searches for "Depends-On:" lines in the
commit message (and recursively in the commit messages of the dependent
changes) and adds all of them to the gating list. This happens through Gerrit
server's public REST API.

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml

- name: Build custom RPMs
  hosts: virthost
  roles:
    - ansible-role-tripleo-gate
